# N-tier Architecture Example

This is a simple example of a PHP application built using N-tier Architecture principles. The example demonstrates how to structure a user management system following the N-tier Architecture approach.

## What is N-tier Architecture?

N-tier Architecture (also known as multi-tier architecture) is a client-server architecture in which the presentation, processing, and data management functions are physically separated. The "N" in N-tier refers to the number of tiers (or layers) that are being used.

The main goals of N-tier Architecture are:

1. **Separation of concerns**: Each tier has a specific responsibility.
2. **Scalability**: Different tiers can be scaled independently based on the needs.
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one tier should not affect other tiers.
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different applications.
5. **Security**: Security can be implemented at different tiers.

## The Tiers of N-tier Architecture

A typical N-tier Architecture consists of at least three tiers:

1. **Presentation Tier** (topmost tier): Handles user interface and user interaction. It's responsible for displaying information to the user and interpreting user commands. This tier communicates with the Business tier.

2. **Business Tier** (middle tier): Contains the business logic, business rules, and workflows. It processes the data between the Presentation and Data tiers. This tier communicates with both the Presentation and Data tiers.

3. **Data Tier** (bottommost tier): Responsible for data storage and retrieval. It includes data access components that interact with the database. This tier communicates with the Business tier.

Additional tiers can be added based on the complexity of the application, such as:

4. **Integration Tier**: Handles communication with external systems or services.
5. **Security Tier**: Manages authentication, authorization, and other security aspects.
6. **Service Tier**: Provides services to other applications or systems.

## The Dependency Rule

In N-tier Architecture, dependencies flow downward. Higher tiers depend on lower tiers, but lower tiers should not depend on higher tiers.

## Project Structure

This example follows the N-tier Architecture principles with the following structure:

```
n_tier_architecture/
├── Presentation/           # Presentation tier
│   └── UserController.php  # Controller for handling user requests
├── Business/               # Business tier
│   └── UserService.php     # Service for user business logic
├── Data/                   # Data tier
│   └── UserRepository.php  # Repository for user data access
├── Database/               # Database connection
│   └── DatabaseConnection.php  # Database connection handler
├── Model/                  # Shared models
│   └── User.php            # User model
└── example.php             # Example script demonstrating the architecture
```

## How This Example Adheres to N-tier Architecture

1. **Presentation Tier**:
   - Contains the `UserController` that handles user requests and responses.
   - Depends on the Business Tier.

2. **Business Tier**:
   - Contains the `UserService` that implements business logic.
   - Depends on the Data Tier.

3. **Data Tier**:
   - Contains the `UserRepository` that handles data access.
   - Depends on the Database connection.

4. **Database Connection**:
   - Handles database operations.
   - Doesn't depend on any other tier.

## Running the Example

To run the example, execute the `example.php` script:

```bash
php example.php
```

This will demonstrate:
1. Creating a user
2. Retrieving a user by ID
3. Getting all users
4. Updating a user
5. Deleting a user

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Scalability**: Each tier can be scaled independently based on the needs.
2. **Maintainability**: The code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify.
3. **Flexibility**: The implementation details of each tier can be changed without affecting other tiers.
4. **Security**: Security can be implemented at different tiers.
5. **Performance**: Performance can be optimized at different tiers.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to apply N-tier Architecture principles to a simple PHP application. By following these principles, you can create systems that are more scalable, maintainable, and flexible.
