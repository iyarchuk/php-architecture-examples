# Reactive Architecture Example

This example demonstrates the implementation of Reactive Architecture, which focuses on building systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven.

## Overview

Reactive Architecture is designed for systems that need to handle:
- High concurrency
- Real-time data processing
- Asynchronous communication
- Event-driven workflows

This architecture follows the principles outlined in the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/):

1. **Responsive**: Systems respond in a timely manner
2. **Resilient**: Systems remain responsive in the face of failure
3. **Elastic**: Systems stay responsive under varying workload
4. **Message-Driven**: Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing

## Components in this Example

### 1. Event Stream
The `EventStream.php` class represents a stream of events that can be subscribed to and processed asynchronously.

### 2. Publisher-Subscriber Implementation
The `EventPublisher.php` and `EventSubscriber.php` demonstrate the publisher-subscriber pattern for asynchronous communication.

### 3. Reactive Data Processing
The `ReactiveProcessor.php` shows how to process data streams reactively.

### 4. Stock Price Monitor Example
A practical example of reactive architecture applied to a stock price monitoring system:
- `StockPriceEvent.php`: Represents price change events
- `StockPricePublisher.php`: Publishes stock price updates
- `PriceAlertSubscriber.php`: Reacts to price changes
- `TradingVolumeProcessor.php`: Processes trading volume data reactively

## How to Use

The `index.php` file demonstrates how these components work together in a reactive system. It shows:
1. Setting up event publishers and subscribers
2. Processing event streams
3. Handling backpressure
4. Implementing resilience patterns

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Observer Pattern**: For event notification
2. **Iterator Pattern**: For sequential access to elements in a stream
3. **Reactor Pattern**: For processing asynchronous events
4. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**: For decoupled communication
