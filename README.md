### 2. Clean Architecture
A software design philosophy introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) that separates concerns into concentric layers, with dependencies pointing inward toward the domain core. It emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency rules to create systems that are testable, maintainable, and independent of frameworks, UI, and databases.

![Clean Architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Clean-architecture-Uncle-Bob.jpg)

Dependencies point inward â†‘

**Key Layers (from innermost to outermost):**
- Domain (Entities) - enterprise-wide business rules and entities
- Application (Use Cases) - application-specific business rules
- Interface Adapters - adapters that convert data between use cases and external agencies
- Frameworks & Drivers - frameworks, tools, and delivery mechanisms

**Key Principles:**
- Independence of frameworks - the architecture doesn't depend on the existence of libraries or frameworks
- Testability - business rules can be tested without UI, database, web server, or any external element
- Independence of UI - the UI can change without changing the rest of the system

### 20. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
A style of software design where services are provided to other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. SOA organizes software systems as collections of loosely coupled, interoperable services.

![Service-Oriented Architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/SOA_Detailed_Diagram.png)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Services are autonomous, self-contained units of functionality
- Services are discoverable through a service registry
- Services communicate through standardized protocols (SOAP, REST, etc.)
- Services have well-defined interfaces (contracts)
- Services are reusable across different applications
- Services are loosely coupled and can be composed into larger applications

**Key Components:**
- Services - discrete units of functionality
- Service Registry/Repository - central directory of available services
- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) - middleware for service communication
- Service Contracts - formal definitions of service interfaces
- Service Consumers - applications that use services
- Service Providers - applications that offer services

**Use Cases:**
- Enterprise application integration
- Business-to-business integration
- Legacy system modernization
- Cross-organizational business processes
- Systems requiring high reusability of components
- Applications needing to integrate heterogeneous technologies

**Advantages:**
- Promotes reuse of services across the organization
- Improves interoperability between different systems
- Enables incremental development and deployment
- Facilitates integration of legacy systems
- Supports business agility through service composition
- Standardized communication protocols

**Disadvantages:**
- Complexity in design and governance
- Performance overhead due to network communication
- Potential for high latency in service calls
- Requires strong governance and service management
- More difficult to debug and trace issues
- Can lead to distributed transaction challenges

**Design Patterns**:
- **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** - centralized bus for communication between services
- **Service Registry** - registry of available services
- **Adapter** - adaptation of interfaces for compatibility
- **Composite Service** - combining multiple services into one
- **Service Layer** - business logic abstraction

### 21. Space-Based Architecture
A pattern aimed at achieving linear scalability of stateful, high-performance applications by removing the central database constraint. It distributes both processing and data across multiple servers using an in-memory data grid or "tuple space."

![Space-Based Architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Space-based-architecture.jpg)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Distributed in-memory data storage
- Shared nothing architecture
- Data co-located with processing units
